# Documentation Guidelines

## Repository Setup

Everyone should start a repository named `<username>-docs` which will contain the documentation of everything done by that person. The `README.md` of this repository should link to all their activities.

## Documentation Requirements

Each person is required to make detailed documentation of their activities on at least a week-to-week basis. This documentation should preferably be done on GitHub using Markdown with MathJax support, and include proper plots and detailed explanations.

### Example Documentation:
- [GitHub based Markdown documentation](add-hyperlink)
- [Slide based documentation](add-hyperlink)

## Meeting Preparation

In addition to your weekly documentation, prepare summary slides for each meeting. These slides should provide a top-down summary of your output since the last meeting.

### Slide Structure

1. **First Slide**: 
    - Summarize the accomplished tasks, whether successful or not.
    - List proposed next action items.

2. **Subsequent Slides**:
    - Go over the details of the accomplished items to understand what worked and what didn't work.
    - Discuss the priorities for the next action items or if entirely new action items should be considered.

### Post-Meeting Update

After the meeting, remember to update the slides with new action items. Add a new slide to capture these updates and any modifications to the action plan.

By following these guidelines, we aim to maintain a consistent documentation format across the team and ensure clear communication during meetings.
