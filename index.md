Welcome to the WCSNG Docs Page!

These docs are a collaborative effort by the members of [Wireless Communication Sensing and Neworking Group](https://wcsng.ucsd.edu) at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu).

Contributing: Check out the [README](https://github.com/ucsdwcsng/wcsng_docs) on the github page.

Testing deployment on wcsng.ucsd.edu

**P.S.**: LLMs are quite useful for generating tutorials and documentation.
