## Introduction
Submitting a paper on time is crucial to participating in academic conferences and journals. Below are guidelines to help you navigate the submission process successfully and avoid missing deadlines.

## Preparation Before Submission

### Understand Submission Requirements
- **Read the Call for Papers:** Familiarize yourself with the specific submission requirements outlined by the conference or journal, including word limits, formatting styles, and required materials (e.g., abstracts, supplementary documents).
- **Check Deadlines:** Note all crucial dates, specifically look for the registration deadline, followed by submission, notification, and camera-ready deadlines. Mark these on your calendar -- I have had students miss deadlines post-acceptance of paper, like camera-ready deadlines.

## Creating Your Paper

### Follow Formatting Guidelines
- **Adhere to Guidelines:** Make sure your paper complies with the specified formatting guidelines (e.g., font size, margin width). Follow these guidelines to avoid immediate rejection.
- **Utilize Templates:** If available, use templates provided by the conference or journal to streamline the formatting process. Here is the one used by the lab, which is universal for all ACM, IEEE, USENIX, and so on [https://github.com/ucsdwcsng/paper-template]. You need to just make flags true or false the `\ieeetrue` or `\acmtrue`.  
- **Embedded Fonts:** Always make figures that have embedded fonts in the figure, especially figures generated by MATLAB that never have embedded fonts. Use PowerPoint, Inkscape, or draw.io to fix it.

### Conduct an Internal Review
- **Peer Review:** Prepare a submission for discussion in the group meeting, ideally two weeks in advance. Before the internal review, have colleagues or collaborators review your paper for content, clarity, and overall quality. Incorporate their feedback to strengthen your paper.

## Submission Process

### Prepare Your Files
- **Check File Formats:** Review the accepted file formats (e.g., PDF, zip of all .tex files) and ensure that all documents are fully prepared for submission.
- **Final Proofread:** Double-check for typographical errors and ensure all required documents are correctly named according to submission guidelines.

### Submit Ahead of Deadline
- **Aim for Early Submission:** Rather than waiting until the last hour, aim to submit your paper a few days before the deadline. This helps you avoid last-minute issues, such as incorrect format or embedded fonts errors and so on.
- **Confirmation of Submission:** After submitting your paper, look for a confirmation email from the platform. Check your submission status or contact support if you do not receive one. Finally, run a shasum check to see that the version of the PDF uploaded is correct and the final version.

## Special Section: Navigating the Quirkiness of EDAS
EDAS, while widely used, presents unique challenges that can add to the submission stress. Here are specific tips to help you navigate its quirks:

- **Submission Status Confusion:** After submitting, EDAS may show your paper as "valid," only to later indicate issues or notify you that your submission is invalid as the checker takes several hours before sending you an update over email. In rare occasions, you can miss the deadline. To avoid panic, allow sufficient time before the deadline to clarify any status updates. If you notice discrepancies, promptly fix the error, upload another version, and make sure you don't repeat the same mistake in future submissions.

- **User Interface:** The EDAS interface can be less intuitive than other platforms. Please take some time to familiarize yourself with it, looking for where important notifications and submission requirements are located.

- **Documentation:** Record all emails during the submission steps, including any notifications received and issues encountered. This documentation will be useful if you must follow up with support or the organizers.

## Post-Submission Actions
- **Monitor Submission Status:** Regularly check the submission system for status updates and notifications.
- **Prepare for Feedback:** Start thinking about possible revisions and responses to reviewers' comments, which can help you move efficiently into revisions when feedback arrives.

## Conclusion and Final Tips
By following these guidelines, including understanding the quirks of EDAS, you can streamline the paper submission process and significantly reduce the risk of missing deadlines. Always plan ahead, stay organized, and utilize available resources to ensure a smooth submission experience. Good luck, and happy writing!
